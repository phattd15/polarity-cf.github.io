Hi! I'm a junior at Toyo University, class of 2025, with a passion for software engineering.

I've had the opportunity to intern at Google and Codedrills, where I gained hands-on experience in software development and project management. Currently, I am working part-time for FPT Japan Holdings, where I continue to expand my knowledge and skills in software engineering.

My skills are diverse, spanning from frontend to backend development, as well as mobile development. In my free time, I'm passionate about competitive programming and have achieved Codeforces Master and AtCoder Yellow level rankings.
